# EN3150 — Assignment 03

This repository contains the work for EN3150 Assignment 03. The assignment implements and experiments with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using example notebooks.

## Files

- [cnn_group_minions.ipynb](https://github.com/Chathura-Jayasinghe/EN3150_Assignment_03/blob/main/cnn_group_minions.ipynb) — Primary notebook with the CNN implementation, training, and evaluation.
- [cnn_group_minions2.ipynb](https://github.com/Chathura-Jayasinghe/EN3150_Assignment_03/blob/main/cnn_group_minions2.ipynb) — Alternative/extended notebook with further experiments and analysis.

## How to run

1. Open either notebook in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab.
2. If using Colab, upload the notebook or open it directly from the repository URL.
3. Make sure you have the required Python packages installed (e.g., tensorflow/keras, numpy, matplotlib). Install missing packages with `pip install`.
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially. The notebooks include data loading, model definition, training, and evaluation steps.

## Notes

- Large outputs or model checkpoints are not included in this repository. Run the notebooks to reproduce results.
